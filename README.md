## Quick Start

angular_init (called `ngi`) creates AngularJS templates for you from the command line **so you don't have to type the same starting code over and over again**. It's a tool with just one purpose, so it's small and fast.

### Get up and running in seconds

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/ngi.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/ngi)

```shell
$ gem install ngi
$ cd ~/MyAwesomeApp # => go to your app
$ ngi controller # => create a new AngularJS controller
```

## Example

### In your shell

![Example](https://github.com/joshbeam/angular_init/blob/master/ngi_example.gif "Example")

### Output (new boilerplate code)

```javascript
// ~/MyAwesomeApp/myAwesome.controller.js

;(function(app) {

  'use strict';

  app.controller('MyAwesomeController',MyAwesomeController);

  MyAwesomeController.$inject = ['$route', '$scope'];

  function MyAwesomeController($route, $scope) {
  
  }

})(angular.module('myModule'));
```

By the way, the output of this little tool is meant to follow [John Papa's AngularJS Style Guide][style-guide].

## Features

### What's new in 0.4.x?

- You can now use **custom templates** ([tutorial][tutorial])

*Have an idea for a feature? Email frontendcollisionblog@gmail.com! Just write: "Hey, I think it would be awesome if you included ____ in ngi because ____."*

- Has **default templates** to create components for you (directives, controllers, etc.) in ECMAScript5 and CoffeeScript (type `ngi -h` to see all the available components). By the way, the default templates follow [John Papa's AngularJS Style Guide][style-guide].
- Supports **custom templates** (see the [tutorial][tutorial] for that)

## Installation

You need [Ruby 2.1.0][ruby] and [RubyGems][rubygems] (optional [Bundler][bundler])

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'ngi'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ngi
